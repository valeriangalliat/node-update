Node Update
===========

Update a portable Node.js installation.

Description
-----------

This command will download the latest Node.js version into the specified
directory (with the specified architecture) and when ran again with the
same parameters, will try to update if a new version came out.

When updating, all files from the new archive will be copied but the added
files (like modules and stuff) are kept.

Example
-------

If you want a local installation for your user:

```sh
mkdir node && cd node

# Install 64-bit version in current directory
node-update

cd ..

# Install 32-bit version in custom directory
node-update -a 32 -t node

# Add Node.js binaries to environment
echo "PATH=$(pwd)/node/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile
```
